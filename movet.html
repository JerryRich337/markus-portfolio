            For <span><strong><a class="underline iamdb-underline" href="https://storied-dieffenbachia-529cb0.netlify.app/">Movet</a></strong></span>, I took it upon myself to collaborate with various athletes and coaching staff at the University of Waterloo to develop a performance dashboard that visualizes data from wearable devices. As well as PROMIS surveys. This tool aims to enhance athletes and coaching personnel's ability to monitor and regulate performance.

              The significance of data metrics in all professions is rising. But data visualization can be an inconvenience to some. In facing this challenge, I sought out a couple of athletes and coaches that I am acquainted with to create a performance data dashboard to help quantify various metrics.
              In order to gain the most utility out of this dashboard, I created a storyboard, speed-dated with users, and ran surveys with coaches. Two primary use cases were then determined: remote athlete monitoring with quantitative-based conversations between coaches and athletes. The dashboards UI was then designed and implemented into an interactive prototype via React.
              The Movet dashboard allows coaches to conveniently access their athletes data, promoting more informed coaching decisions and ultimately enhanced athlete performance management. By removing the barrier of gathering data and modelling it, this dashboard ensures real time quantitative-based decision making between athlete and coach.

            <h4 class="section-text iamdb-right right-text">
              Through conducting surveys, it was determined that Movet should cover Quantitative Discussions between athletes and staff, but also provide convenience for staff in remote athlete monitoring.
              Below is the aggregated view, which compiled all significant data. It was hypothesised that this macro view of all athletes and their data could provide coaching personnel a quick way to determine which athletes would need accommodations.
              Beyond the macro display, a more detailed individual athlete view was prototyped. It was beleived that this view could assist coaches to craft and tailer specific recovery plans on an athlete to athlete basis.

            <h4 class="section-text iamdb-right right-text">
              The mid-fidelity prototypes were designed to conduct user studies in order to assess the current state of the dashboard in regards to the primary use cases. Six variations were created, each with a unique feature.

            <h4 class="section-text iamdb-right right-text">
              The first round of user testing consisted of sending out wireframes to team staff and various athletes. Many opened the jpg wireframes and edited over them with pens/ highlighters. Overall the feedback was positive, many team staff confirmed that the dashboard addressed the relevant needs in athlete injury diagnosis and recovery.
              After evaluating the feedback from the mid-fidelity wireframes, the high-fidelity wireframes were developed with ANT design. From styles to components.
